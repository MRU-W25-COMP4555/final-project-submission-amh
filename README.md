How to run BallOut:

*__NOTE:__* the .exe can only be ran on a windows PC, no Mac... sorry

1. Open FinalBuild folder
2. Open BallOut folder
3. Run the "BallOut.exe" file
4. It might bring up Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, so click "more info" and then run anyway
5. The game will load, the main menu screen might be smaller depending on the screen size you're using but click start to play the game
6. The controls are: WASD to move and 'F' to throw
